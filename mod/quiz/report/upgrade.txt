This files describes API changes for quiz report plugins.

Overview of this plugin type at http://docs.moodle.org/dev/Quiz_reports


=== earlier versions ===

* ... API changes were not documented properly. Sorry. (There weren't many!)


=== 2.2 ===

* Plugins should be converted to implement cron in the standard way. In lib.php,
define a
function quiz_myreportname_cron() {};
This replaces the old way of having a separate cron.php file. Also, the cron
frequency should be defined in version.php, not in the quiz_reports table.


=== 2.3 ===

* Support for the old way of doing cron in a separate cron.php file has been removed.
